BicycleObserverPatternApp
=========================

This is my first go at implementing the observer design pattern, in C#. After coding this, I quickly realised how powerful this design pattern can be - especially thinking how it might be used in large-scale enterprise apps. I learned the observer pattern in my programming class, and by looking at sites such as http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternObserver.aspx.
